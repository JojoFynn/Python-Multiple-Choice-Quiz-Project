# Python-Multiple-Choice-Quiz-Project
This code was created by me in my first year using Python Programming. Its a multiple choice quiz application. Turtle graphics was implemented into the application.
The project functions file contains all the questions needed for the quiz application and the test file is where all print statements can be found. It is also a place where the file is actually run from.
